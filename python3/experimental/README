HOW TO RUN

Install onto Ubuntu 12.10 packages:
* python-bottle (on 2013-02-13 version was 0.10.11-1)
* gunicorn (on 2013-02-13 version was 0.14.5-3ubuntu1)
* maybe need pip after all for Pyro4

Place file "app.py" into /var/www/bottle/wiki

Copy file "wiki-gunicorn-conf" as /etc/gunicorn.d/wiki

Integrate nginx-default into /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Run one of three ways.  First cd /var/www/bottle/wiki, then pick one:
* python app.py                # run as main under python 2
* python3 app.py               # run as main under python 3
* gunicorn app:application     # run under gunicorn manually
* service gunicorn start       # run as a service
* service nginx start          # run bottle through nginx proxy
