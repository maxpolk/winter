# winter

Winter is a computing platform based on a wiki whose pages are code or data, combinined to form arbitrary content.  The code can be any domain-specific language.  The data can either be immediate information, or else a reference to external information, such as a web API, a web resource like a news feed, a database lookup, a directory of files, local system information, the output of a command or program, or anything else.

The goal of Winter is to bring software development to everyone.  No tool is needed other than a browser, and no skill is needed other than an ability to type simple text to morph data.  By emphasizing smaller steps and then combining them, no one page is ever complex.  Testing and releasing are built-in to complete the platform.

# install

To install, use PyPi, which should pull in the dependencies:

    pip3 install winter

If you change the source and/or want to create a distribution, use the setup.py script:
