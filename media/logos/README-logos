The image Winter-logo-source.jpg, from which the logos derived, came from:

    http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schnee1.jpg

This public domain image was altered in Gimp to reverse the image,
add an alpha channel, make the background transparent, then use
the colorize tool with settings somewhere around 210,62,29, and
then resized.

Resizing down to 14x14 produced a blur, therefore it was first
resized to 32x32, touched up, colors made more saturated, and
then resized to 14x14 so it looks actually like a snowflake.
